## What is Apache Pulsar?

> Apache Pulsar is an open-source distributed pub-sub messaging system originally created at Yahoo and now part of the Apache Software Foundation

_Source:_ [What is Apache Pulsar](http://pulsar.apache.org)


## History

Pulsar was first developed at Yahoo Inc. by that company’s former engineers Matteo Merli and Joe Francis and donated to the open-source community in 2016. Merli and Francis explained at the time that Pulsar was developed in order to meet the requirements of several Yahoo applications, for which they could not find any existing solution.

Merli later left Yahoo to form the startup Streamlio with the intention of commercializing Apache Pulsar, launching a real-time analytics suite that incorporates the messaging system in September. Streamlio’s system also incorporates open-source projects such as Heron and Apache BookKeeper, which combine to create “an enterprise-grade messaging solution optimized for streaming and storage.”

Now, the Apache Pulsar community is updating Pulsar with new analytics capabilities and enhancements under the hood that should boost its performance, scalability and durability.
